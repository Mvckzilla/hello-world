<p> As a fresh college grad, I am not quite happy with the path I have chosen. So I am teaching myself to code. Please help. XD </p>
<p>I went to Purdue Uni for Hositality Management, but after graduating and trying to see myself working in the field, its okay. But when I think about the hours I spent on fucking myspace coding the coolest profile page, I am excited. I didn't go into CS because I was a lazy fucker who decided an easy schoolwork path was better than trying to learn calculus and probably graduate late because I was behind already.</p>
<p>Now I sit in this corporate scam of a job, with my fancy degree pissed off because I didn't.t But I could have done it. So here I am. I still don't need calculus to learn to code and design websites.</p>
